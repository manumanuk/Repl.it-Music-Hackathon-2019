**IMPORTANT NOTE**
Sonify was created on a 2018 Macbook Pro with Apple's built-in speakers and an Intel Core I7 processor. Depending on your operating system, processor, and speaker system, audio quality can **vary wildly**. For the most optimized experience, listen to your created images using the hardware given above.

## About Sonify
***
Inspired by the 500th sunrise seen by NASA's Martian rover Opportunity, researchers Dr. Domenico Vicinanza and Dr. Genevieve Williams worked to [generate a script](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9Z8Z3MZXpo) which would convert the image into sound. The result was a two minute masterpiece that combined landscape data and information about the brightness of pixels as read from left to right along the image. Who knew the visual beauty of such a breathtaking image was pleasing to more than one of the senses? Therefore, in tribute to Oppy and the beauty of the Martian sunrise, _S o n i f y ._ hopes to sonificate your favourite online images into the masterpieces they hide beneath. Based on the intensity of the RGB values of each pixel, Sonify scans your images and plays a frequency for each colour corresponding to each one's intensity.

## Example Images
***
To begin, try running the example images given on the site. The two red gradient images are basic examples of Sonify's capabilities, showing how the pitch of the sound rises or falls based on the colour intensity in the pixels of the image. You will find that for interesting images such as the Martian Sunrise, the pitch of the sounds begins to slowly increase as the intensity of the blue in the background increases. Meanwhile, you will begin to hear a separate pitch emerge and fade rapidly as the sun comes into the foreground. As each of these elements begin to fade, the pitch, too, slowly drops. Meanwhile, for the brightly coloured sunset image, you may find that it begins with a high pitch originating from the blue in the image, which slowly drops as the red takes over in a different tone of sound. Suddenly, as the waves hit, the pitch of the piece drops significantly, and only jumps occasionally to reflect the red hues of the sunlight on the waves, or the successions of blue and black that occur as the progress bar follows the image. Every image is a work of art. With Sonify, you may find the most intriguing details in your most beloved masterpieces in a whole new way.

## Instructions for Use
***
> Tip: You will find that images of nature tend to be more elegant in their quality of sound than human-made objects or complex objects with lots of detail.

To play a clip consisting of your own image, simply choose which direction you want the pixels to play in - be it top to bottom or left to right (i.e. read and play row-by-row or column-by-column respectively). A dialogue will pop up.



Enter the URL of an image you found online and press "enter" or the OK button on the dialogue.



**Be patient while your image loads.** If it does not load after approximately 10s, pick a different image (or, if you really really want to try that particular image, fork this repl and upload the gif or jpeg as a replacement to the example ones given). Once your image has loaded, press the Analyze button to begin analyzing the image and playing the sounds created by the pixels. A red triangle will appear showing the location of the row/column being played at the current moment.


Sit back and enjoy.
